How do I understand what people need and build it?
I listen to what the user wants and turn that into “user stories.” These stories help me focus on building features that really matter to people.
How do I like to build programs?
I use Agile methods like sprints and stand-ups to break work into small parts. It helps me stay on track and adjust quickly if something changes.
What makes someone a good teammate in coding?
A good teammate helps others, communicates well, and finishes their part. They also stay kind, share ideas, and work together to make the project better.
